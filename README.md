# GigaBoy
Gameboy emulator written in C#

# Important note on running the emulator
The emulator currently depends on several files to run, and these files are not automatically packaged with the executable when it runs. 
These files are in this repository, but you have to manually move them to the correct relative directories before running the emulator, otherwise it will crash.
